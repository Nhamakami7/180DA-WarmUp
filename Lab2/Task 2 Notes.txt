Task 2.
a. Some things that we can do with speech recognition in our project include:
- Using speech as an input to select a move in a game.
- Using speech as a means of interacting with an NPC.

b. I don't think it's reasonable for our speech recognition to be too complicated, simply due to issues with differentiating between similar sounding words or phrases.

c. One idea our team is thinking of is making a turn-based game, which would make quick speech recognition less important, as there are no real-time actions being done.
However, if we were to go the route of an action game, a missed or delayed recognition could greatly affect the game.

d. The main condition for consistency would be a room with low noise levels while the game is on. I'm not entirely sure what hardware would be needed though.
